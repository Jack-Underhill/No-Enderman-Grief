# Modrinth listing draft

Draft copy for the consolidated listing at https://modrinth.com/plugin/no-enderman-grief-2025 (hosts both the Paper plugin and the Fabric mod as separate versions in one project) — mirrors what's live as of 2026-09-05. Paste/adapt into Modrinth's editor, don't upload this file itself.

**Title:** Enderman Grief Control

**Summary** (short tagline field):
> Stop Endermen from stealing and placing blocks without disabling mobGriefing: no world grief, no new persistent block-carrying Endermen.

**Description** (long-form field, below):

---

Enderman Grief Control stops Endermen from picking up or placing blocks without disabling `mobGriefing` for the rest of your world.

It affects only Endermen, preventing new persistent block-carrying Endermen while leaving other vanilla mob behavior unchanged.

## Why use Enderman Grief Control?

- **Endermen only:** Keep the fix focused on the mob causing the problem.
- **Pickup and placement blocked:** Prevent Endermen from taking blocks or placing carried blocks back into the world.
- **No global gamerule tradeoff:** Leave `mobGriefing` enabled for farms, villagers, sheep, and other mechanics that rely on it.
- **Persistent carrier prevention:** Stop new block-carrying Endermen from being created and building up over time.

*(Enabled/Disabled comparison screenshots go here on the live listing.)*
